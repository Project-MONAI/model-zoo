# Model Overview

A pre-trained model for simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei within multi-tissue histology images based on CoNSeP data. The details of the model can be found in [1].

## Workflow

The model is trained to simultaneous segment and classify nuclei. Training is done via a two-stage approach. First initialized the model with pre-trained weights on the [ImageNet dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206848), trained only the decoders for the first 50 epochs, and then fine-tuned all layers for another 50 epochs. There are two training modes in total. If "original" mode is specified, it uses [270, 270] and [80, 80] for `patch_size` and `out_size` respectively. If "fast" mode is specified, it uses [256, 256] and [164, 164] for `patch_size` and `out_size` respectively. The results we show below are based on the "fast" model.

- We train the first stage with pre-trained weights from some internal data.

- The original author's repo also has pre-trained weights which is for non-commercial use. Each user is responsible for checking the content of models/datasets and the applicable licenses and determining if suitable for the intended use. The license for the pre-trained model is different than MONAI license. Please check the source where these weights are obtained from: <https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net#data-format>

## Data

The training data is from <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/hovernet/>.

- Target: segment instance-level nuclei and classify the nuclei type
- Task: Segmentation and classification
- Modality: RGB images
- Size: 41 image tiles (2009 patches)

The provided labelled data was partitioned, based on the original split, into training (27 tiles) and testing (14 tiles) datasets.

After download the datasets, please run `scripts/prepare_patches.py` to prepare patches from tiles. Prepared patches are saved in `your-concep-dataset-path`/Prepared. The implementation is referring to <https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net/blob/master/extract_patches.py>. The command is like:

```
python scripts/prepare_patches.py -root your-concep-dataset-path
```

## Training configuration

This model utilized a two-stage approach. The training was performed with the following:

- GPU: At least 24GB of GPU memory.
- Actual Model Input: 256 x 256
- AMP: True
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 1e-4
- Loss: HoVerNetLoss

## Input

Input: RGB images

## Output

Output: a dictionary with the following keys:

1. nucleus_prediction: predict whether or not a pixel belongs to the nuclei or background
2. horizontal_vertical: predict the horizontal and vertical distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass
3. type_prediction: predict the type of nucleus for each pixel

## Model Performance

The achieved metrics on the validation data are:

Fast mode:
- Binary Dice: 0.8013
- PQ: 0.4629
- F1d: 0.7370

## commands example

Execute training:

- Run first stage

```
python -m monai.bundle run training --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/train.json --logging_file configs/logging.conf --network_def#pretrained_url `PRETRAIN_MODEL_URL` --stage 0
```

- Run second stage

```
python -m monai.bundle run training --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/train.json --logging_file configs/logging.conf --network_def#freeze_encoder false --network_def#pretrained_url None --stage 1
```

Override the `train` config to execute multi-GPU training:

- Run first stage

```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 -m monai.bundle run training --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/multi_gpu_train.json']" --logging_file configs/logging.conf --train#dataloader#batch_size 8 --network_def#freeze_encoder true --network_def#pretrained_url `PRETRAIN_MODEL_URL` --stage 0
```

- Run second stage

```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 -m monai.bundle run training --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/multi_gpu_train.json']" --logging_file configs/logging.conf --train#dataloader#batch_size 4 --network_def#freeze_encoder false --network_def#pretrained_url None --stage 1
```

Override the `train` config to execute evaluation with the trained model:

```
python -m monai.bundle run evaluating --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/evaluate.json']" --logging_file configs/logging.conf
```

### Execute inference

```
python -m monai.bundle run evaluating --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/inference.json --logging_file configs/logging.conf
```
