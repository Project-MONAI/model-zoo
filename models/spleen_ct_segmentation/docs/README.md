# Model Overview
A pre-trained model for volumetric (3D) segmentation of the spleen from CT images.

This model is trained using the runner-up [1] awarded pipeline of the "Medical Segmentation Decathlon Challenge 2018" using the UNet architecture [2] with 32 training images and 9 validation images.

## Data
The training dataset is the Spleen Task from the Medical Segmentation Decathalon. Users can find more details on the datasets at http://medicaldecathlon.com/.

- Target: Spleen
- Modality: CT
- Size: 61 3D volumes (41 Training + 20 Testing)
- Source: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
- Challenge: Large-ranging foreground size

## Training configuration
The segmentation of spleen region is formulated as the voxel-wise binary classification. Each voxel is predicted as either foreground (spleen) or background. And the model is optimized with gradient descent method minimizing Dice + cross entropy loss between the predicted mask and ground truth segmentation.

The training was performed with the following:

- GPU: at least 12GB of GPU memory
- Actual Model Input: 96 x 96 x 96
- AMP: True
- Optimizer: Novograd
- Learning Rate: 0.002
- Loss: DiceCELoss
- Dataset Manager: CacheDataset

### Memory Consumption Warning

If you face memory issues with CacheDataset, you can either switch to a regular Dataset class or lower the caching rate `cache_rate` in the configurations within range [0, 1] to minimize the System RAM requirements.

### Input
One channel
- CT image

### Output
Two channels
- Label 1: spleen
- Label 0: everything else

## Performance
Dice score is used for evaluating the performance of the model. This model achieves a mean dice score of 0.961.

#### TensorRT speedup
The `spleen_ct_segmentation` bundle supports acceleration with TensorRT through the ONNX-TensorRT method. The table below displays the speedup ratios observed on an A100 80G GPU.

| method | torch_fp32(ms) | torch_amp(ms) | trt_fp32(ms) | trt_fp16(ms) | speedup amp | speedup fp32 | speedup fp16 | amp vs fp16|
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| model computation | 6.46 | 4.48 | 2.52 | 1.96 | 1.44 | 2.56 | 3.30 | 2.29 |
| end2end | 1268.03 | 1152.40 | 1137.40 | 1114.25 | 1.10 | 1.11 | 1.14 | 1.03 |

Where:
- `model computation` means the speedup ratio of model's inference with a random input without preprocessing and postprocessing
- `end2end` means run the bundle end-to-end with the TensorRT based model.
- `torch_fp32` and `torch_amp` are for the PyTorch models with or without `amp` mode.
- `trt_fp32` and `trt_fp16` are for the TensorRT based models converted in corresponding precision.
- `speedup amp`, `speedup fp32` and `speedup fp16` are the speedup ratios of corresponding models versus the PyTorch float32 model
- `amp vs fp16` is the speedup ratio between the PyTorch amp model and the TensorRT float16 based model.

Currently, the only available method to accelerate this model is through ONNX-TensorRT. However, the Torch-TensorRT method is under development and will be available in the near future.

This result is benchmarked under:
 - TensorRT: 8.5.3+cuda11.8
 - Torch-TensorRT Version: 1.4.0
 - CPU Architecture: x86-64
 - OS: ubuntu 20.04
 - Python version:3.8.10
 - CUDA version: 12.1
 - GPU models and configuration: A100 80G

## MONAI Bundle Commands
In addition to the Pythonic APIs, a few command line interfaces (CLI) are provided to interact with the bundle. The CLI supports flexible use cases, such as overriding configs at runtime and predefining arguments in a file.

For more details usage instructions, visit the [MONAI Bundle Configuration Page](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/config_syntax.html).

#### Execute training:

```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file configs/train.json
```

#### Override the `train` config to execute multi-GPU training:

```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 -m monai.bundle run --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/multi_gpu_train.json']"
```

Please note that the distributed training-related options depend on the actual running environment; thus, users may need to remove `--standalone`, modify `--nnodes`, or do some other necessary changes according to the machine used. For more details, please refer to [pytorch's official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).

#### Override the `train` config to execute evaluation with the trained model:

```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/evaluate.json']"
```

#### Override the `train` config and `evaluate` config to execute multi-GPU evaluation:

```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 -m monai.bundle run --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/evaluate.json','configs/multi_gpu_evaluate.json']"
```

#### Execute inference:

```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file configs/inference.json
```

#### Export checkpoint to TensorRT based models with fp32 or fp16 precision:

```
python -m monai.bundle trt_export --net_id network_def --filepath models/model_trt.ts --ckpt_file models/model.pt --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/inference.json --precision <fp32/fp16> --dynamic_batchsize "[1, 4, 8]" --use_onnx "True" --use_trace "True"
```

#### Execute inference with the TensorRT model:

```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file "['configs/inference.json', 'configs/inference_trt.json']"
```
