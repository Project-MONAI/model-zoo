## **Model Description**
The model is the SegResNet architecture[1] for volumetric (3D) renal structures segmentation. Input is artery, vein, excretory phases after mutual registration and concatenated to 3 channel 3D tensor.


## **Data**
DICOM data from 41 patients with kidney neoplasms were used. Data included all phases of contrast-enhanced multispiral computed tomography. We split the data: 32 observations for the training set and 9 – for the validation set. At the labeling stage, the arterial, venous, and excretory phases were taken, affine registration was performed to jointly match the location of the kidneys, and noise was removed using a median filter and a non-local means filter. Validation set ip published to Yandex.Disk. You can download via [link](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/pWEKt6D3qi3-aw) or use following command:
```
python -m monai.bundle run download_data --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json', 'configs/evaluate.json']"
```

**NB**: underlying data is in LPS orientation. IF! you want to test model on your own data, reorient it from RAS to LPS with `Orientation` transform. You can see example of preprocessing pipeline in `inference.json` file of this bundle.

#### **Preprocessing**
Images are (1) croped to kidney region, all (artery,vein,excret) phases are (2) [registered](https://simpleitk.readthedocs.io/en/master/registrationOverview.html#lbl-registration-overview) with affine transform, noise removed with (3) median and (4) non-local means filter. After that, images are (5) resampled to (0.8,0.8,0.8) density and intesities are (6) scaled from [-1000,1000] to [0,1] range. 

## **Performance**
On the validation subset, the values of the Dice score of the SegResNet architecture were: 0.89 for the normal parenchyma of the kidney, 0.58 for the kidney neoplasms, 0.86 for arteries, 0.80 for veins, 0.80 for ureters.

When compared with the nnU-Net model, which was trained on KiTS 21 dataset, the Dice score was greater for the kidney parenchyma in SegResNet – 0.89 compared to three model variants: lowres – 0.69, fullres – 0.70, cascade – 0.69. At the same time, for the neoplasms of the parenchyma of the kidney, the Dice score was comparable: for SegResNet – 0.58, for nnU-Net fullres – 0.59; lowres and cascade had lower Dice score of 0.37 and 0.45, respectively.

## **Additional Usage Steps**

#### Execute training:

```
python -m monai.bundle run training --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/train.json
```
Expected result: finished, Training process started


#### Execute training with finetuning
```
python -m monai.bundle run training --dont_finetune false --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/train.json
```
Expected result: finished, Training process started, model variables are restored

#### Execute validation:

##### Download validation data:
```
cd models/renalStructures_CECT_segmantation 
python -m monai.bundle run download_data --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json', 'configs/evaluate.json']"
```
Expected result: finished, `data/` folder is created and filled with images.

#####  Run validation script:
```
python -m monai.bundle run evaluate --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json', 'configs/evaluate.json']"
```
Expected result: finished, `Key metric: val_mean_dice best value: 0.7844631671905518 at epoch: 1` is printed.

## **System Configuration**
The model was trained for 10000 epochs on 2 RTX2080Ti GPUs with [SmartCacheDataset](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/data.html#smartcachedataset). This takes 1 days and 2 hours, with 4 images per GPU.
Training progress is available on [tensorboard.dev](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/VlEMjLdURH6SyFp216dFBg)


## **Limitations** 
For developmental purposes only and cannot be used directly for clinical procedures.
