# Model Overview
A pre-trained model for volumetric (3D) detection of the lung nodule from CT image.

This model is trained on LUNA16 dataset (https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Home/), using the RetinaNet (Lin, Tsung-Yi, et al. "Focal loss for dense object detection." ICCV 2017. https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002).

## Data
The dataset we are experimenting in this example is LUNA16 (https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Home/), which is based on [LIDC-IDRI database](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI) [3,4,5].

LUNA16 is a public dataset of CT lung nodule detection. Using raw CT scans, the goal is to identify locations of possible nodules, and to assign a probability for being a nodule to each location.

Disclaimer: We are not the host of the data. Please make sure to read the requirements and usage policies of the data and give credit to the authors of the dataset! We acknowledge the National Cancer Institute and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, and their critical role in the creation of the free publicly available LIDC/IDRI Database used in this study.

### 10-fold data splitting
We follow the official 10-fold data splitting from LUNA16 challenge and generate data split json files using the script from [nnDetection](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnDetection/blob/main/projects/Task016_Luna/scripts/prepare.py).

Please download the resulted json files from https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI-extra-test-data/releases/download/0.8.1/LUNA16_datasplit-20220615T233840Z-001.zip.

In these files, the values of "box" are the ground truth boxes in world coordinate.

### Data resampling
The raw CT images in LUNA16 have various of voxel sizes. The first step is to resample them to the same voxel size.
In this model, we resampled them into 0.703125 x 0.703125 x 1.25 mm.

Please following the instruction in Section 3.1 of https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/detection to do the resampling.

### Data download
The mhd/raw original data can be downloaded from [LUNA16](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Home/). The DICOM original data can be downloaded from [LIDC-IDRI database](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI) [3,4,5]. You will need to resample the original data to start training.

Alternatively, we provide [resampled nifti images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JozrufA1VIZWJIc5A1EMV3J4CNCYovKK?usp=share_link) and a copy of [original mhd/raw images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-enN4eNEnKmjltevKg3W2V-Aj0nriQWE?usp=share_link) from [LUNA16](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Home/) for users to download.

## Training configuration
The training was performed with the following:

- GPU: at least 16GB GPU memory
- Actual Model Input: 192 x 192 x 80
- AMP: True
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 1e-2
- Loss: BCE loss and L1 loss

### Input
1 channel
- List of 3D CT patches

### Output
In Training Mode: A dictionary of classification and box regression loss.

In Evaluation Mode: A list of dictionaries of predicted box, classification label, and classification score.

## Performance
Coco metric is used for evaluating the performance of the model. The pre-trained model was trained and validated on data fold 0. This model achieves a mAP=0.853, mAR=0.994, AP(IoU=0.1)=0.862, AR(IoU=0.1)=1.0.

Please note that This bundle is non-deterministic because of the max pooling layer used in the network. Therefore, reproduce the training process may not get exactly the same performance.
Please refer to https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.use_deterministic_algorithms.html#torch.use_deterministic_algorithms for more details about the reproducibility.

#### Validation Accuracy
The validation accuracy in this curve is the mean of mAP, mAR, AP(IoU=0.1), and AR(IoU=0.1) in Coco metric.

## MONAI Bundle Commands
In addition to the Pythonic APIs, a few command line interfaces (CLI) are provided to interact with the bundle. The CLI supports flexible use cases, such as overriding configs at runtime and predefining arguments in a file.

For more details usage instructions, visit the [MONAI Bundle Configuration Page](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/config_syntax.html).

#### Execute training:
```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file configs/train.json
```

#### Override the `train` config to execute evaluation with the trained model:
```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/evaluate.json']"
```

#### Execute inference on resampled LUNA16 images by setting `"whether_raw_luna16": false` in `inference.json`:
```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file configs/inference.json
```
With the same command, we can execute inference on original LUNA16 images by setting `"whether_raw_luna16": true` in `inference.json`. Remember to also set `"data_list_file_path": "$@bundle_root + '/LUNA16_datasplit/mhd_original/dataset_fold0.json'"` and change `"dataset_dir"`.

Note that in inference.json, the transform "LoadImaged" in "preprocessing" and "AffineBoxToWorldCoordinated" in "postprocessing" has `"affine_lps_to_ras": true`.
This depends on the input images. LUNA16 needs `"affine_lps_to_ras": true`.
It is possible that your inference dataset should set `"affine_lps_to_ras": false`.
