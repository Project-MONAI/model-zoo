# Model Overview
A pre-trained model for the endoscopic inbody classification task and trained using the SEResNet50 structure, whose details can be found in [1]. All datasets are from private samples of [Activ Surgical](https://www.activsurgical.com/). Samples in training and validation dataset are from the same 4 videos, while test samples are from different two videos.

The [PyTorch model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14CS-s1uv2q6WedYQGeFbZeEWIkoyNa-x/view?usp=sharing) and [torchscript model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fOoJ4n5DWKHrt9QXTZ2sXwr9C-YvVGCM/view?usp=sharing) are shared in google drive. Modify the `bundle_root` parameter specified in `configs/train.json` and `configs/inference.json` to reflect where models are downloaded. Expected directory path to place downloaded models is `models/` under `bundle_root`.

## Data
The datasets used in this work were provided by [Activ Surgical](https://www.activsurgical.com/).

We've provided a [link](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI-extra-test-data/releases/download/0.8.1/inbody_outbody_samples.zip) of 20 samples (10 in-body and 10 out-body) to show what this dataset looks like.

### Preprocessing
After downloading this dataset, python script in `scripts` folder named `data_process` can be used to generate label json files by running the command below and modifying `datapath` to path of unziped downloaded data. Generated label json files will be stored in `label` folder under the bundle path.

```
python scripts/data_process.py --datapath /path/to/data/root
```

By default, label path parameter in `train.json` and `inference.json` of this bundle is point to the generated `label` folder under bundle path. If you move these generated label files to another place, please modify the `train_json`, `val_json` and `test_json` parameters specified in `configs/train.json` and `configs/inference.json` to where these label files are.

The input label json should be a list made up by dicts which includes `image` and `label` keys. An example format is shown below.

```
[
    {
        "image":"/path/to/image/image_name0.jpg",
        "label": 0
    },
    {
        "image":"/path/to/image/image_name1.jpg",
        "label": 0
    },
    {
        "image":"/path/to/image/image_name2.jpg",
        "label": 1
    },
    ....
    {
        "image":"/path/to/image/image_namek.jpg",
        "label": 0
    },
]
```

#### TensorRT speedup
The `endoscopic_inbody_classification` bundle supports the TensorRT acceleration through the ONNX-TensorRT way. The table below shows the speedup ratios benchmarked on an A100 80G GPU, in which the `model computation` means the speedup ratio of model's inference with a random input without preprocessing and postprocessing and the `end2end` means run the bundle end to end with the TensorRT based model. The `torch_fp32` and `torch_amp` is for the pytorch model with or without `amp` mode. The `trt_fp32` and `trt_fp16` is for the TensorRT based model converted in corresponding precision. The `speedup amp`, `speedup fp32` and `speedup fp16` is the speedup ratio of corresponding models versus the pytorch float32 model, while the `amp vs fp16` is between the pytorch amp model and the TensorRT float16 based model. Currently, this model can only be accelerated through the ONNX-TensorRT way and the Torch-TensorRT way will be comming soon.

| method | torch_fp32(ms) | torch_amp(ms) | trt_fp32(ms) | trt_fp16(ms) | speedup amp | speedup fp32 | speedup fp16 | amp vs fp16|
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| model computation | 6.50 | 9.23 | 2.78 | 2.31 | 0.70 | 2.34 | 2.81 | 4.00 |
| end2end | 23.54 | 23.78 | 7.37 | 7.14 | 0.99 | 3.19 | 3.30 | 3.33 |

This result is benchmarked under:
 - TensorRT: 8.5.3+cuda11.8
 - Torch-TensorRT Version: 1.4.0
 - CPU Architecture: x86-64
 - OS: ubuntu 20.04
 - Python version:3.8.10
 - CUDA version: 11.8
 - GPU models and configuration: A100 80G

## MONAI Bundle Commands
In addition to the Pythonic APIs, a few command line interfaces (CLI) are provided to interact with the bundle. The CLI supports flexible use cases, such as overriding configs at runtime and predefining arguments in a file.

For more details usage instructions, visit the [MONAI Bundle Configuration Page](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/config_syntax.html).

#### Execute training:

```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file configs/train.json
```

#### Override the `train` config to execute multi-GPU training:

```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 -m monai.bundle run \
    --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/multi_gpu_train.json']"
```

Please note that the distributed training-related options depend on the actual running environment; thus, users may need to remove `--standalone`, modify `--nnodes`, or do some other necessary changes according to the machine used. For more details, please refer to [pytorch's official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).

In addition, if using the 20 samples example dataset, the preprocessing script will divide the samples to 16 training samples, 2 validation samples and 2 test samples. However, pytorch multi-gpu training requires number of samples in dataloader larger than gpu numbers. Therefore, please use no more than 2 gpus to run this bundle if using the 20 samples example dataset.

#### Override the `train` config to execute evaluation with the trained model:

```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/evaluate.json']"
```

#### Execute inference:

```
python -m monai.bundle run --config_file configs/inference.json
```
The classification result of every images in `test.json` will be printed to the screen.

#### Export checkpoint to TorchScript file:

```
python -m monai.bundle ckpt_export network_def \
    --filepath models/model.ts \
    --ckpt_file models/model.pt \
    --meta_file configs/metadata.json \
    --config_file configs/inference.json
```

#### Export checkpoint to TensorRT based models with fp32 or fp16 precision:

```bash
python -m monai.bundle trt_export --net_id network_def \
--filepath models/model_trt.ts --ckpt_file models/model.pt \
--meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/inference.json \
--precision <fp32/fp16>  --use_onnx "True" --use_trace "True"
```
