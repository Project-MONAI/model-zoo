# Model Overview
A pre-trained model for volumetric (3D) segmentation of brain tumor subregions from multimodal MRIs based on BraTS 2018 data. The whole pipeline is modified from [clara_pt_brain_mri_segmentation](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/med/models/clara_pt_brain_mri_segmentation).

The model is trained to segment 3 nested subregions of primary brain tumors (gliomas): the "enhancing tumor" (ET), the "tumor core" (TC), the "whole tumor" (WT) based on 4 aligned input MRI scans (T1c, T1, T2, FLAIR).
- The ET is described by areas that show hyper intensity in T1c when compared to T1, but also when compared to "healthy" white matter in T1c.
- The TC describes the bulk of the tumor, which is what is typically resected. The TC entails the ET, as well as the necrotic (fluid-filled) and the non-enhancing (solid) parts of the tumor.
-  The WT describes the complete extent of the disease, as it entails the TC and the peritumoral edema (ED), which is typically depicted by hyper-intense signal in FLAIR.

## Data
The training data is from the [Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/sbia/brats2018/tasks.html).

- Target: 3 tumor subregions
- Task: Segmentation
- Modality: MRI
- Size: 285 3D volumes (4 channels each)

The provided labelled data was partitioned, based on our own split, into training (200 studies), validation (42 studies) and testing (43 studies) datasets.

### Preprocessing
The data list/split can be created with the script `scripts/prepare_datalist.py`.

```
python scripts/prepare_datalist.py --path your-brats18-dataset-path
```

## Training configuration
This model utilized a similar approach described in 3D MRI brain tumor segmentation using autoencoder regularization, which was a winning method in BraTS2018 [1]. The training was performed with the following:

- GPU: At least 16GB of GPU memory.
- Actual Model Input: 224 x 224 x 144
- AMP: True
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 1e-4
- Loss: DiceLoss

## Input
4 channel aligned MRIs at 1 x 1 x 1 mm
- T1c
- T1
- T2
- FLAIR

## Output
3 channels
- Label 0: TC tumor subregion
- Label 1: WT tumor subregion
- Label 2: ET tumor subregion

## Performance
Dice score was used for evaluating the performance of the model. This model achieved Dice scores on the validation data of:
- Tumor core (TC): 0.8559
- Whole tumor (WT): 0.9026
- Enhancing tumor (ET): 0.7905
- Average: 0.8518

## MONAI Bundle Commands
In addition to the Pythonic APIs, a few command line interfaces (CLI) are provided to interact with the bundle. The CLI supports flexible use cases, such as overriding configs at runtime and predefining arguments in a file.

For more details usage instructions, visit the [MONAI Bundle Configuration Page](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/config_syntax.html).

#### Execute training:
```
python -m monai.bundle run training --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/train.json --logging_file configs/logging.conf
```

#### Override the `train` config to execute multi-GPU training:
```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 -m monai.bundle run training --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/multi_gpu_train.json']" --logging_file configs/logging.conf
```

Please note that the distributed training-related options depend on the actual running environment; thus, users may need to remove `--standalone`, modify `--nnodes`, or do some other necessary changes according to the machine used. For more details, please refer to [pytorch's official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).

#### Override the `train` config to execute evaluation with the trained model:
```
python -m monai.bundle run evaluating --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file "['configs/train.json','configs/evaluate.json']" --logging_file configs/logging.conf
```

#### Execute inference:
```
python -m monai.bundle run evaluating --meta_file configs/metadata.json --config_file configs/inference.json --logging_file configs/logging.conf
```
