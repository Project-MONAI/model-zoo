# MONAI Model Zoo

MONAI Model Zoo hosts a collection of medical imaging models in the [MONAI Bundle](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/bundle_intro.html) format.
All source code of models (bundles) are tracked in `models/`, and for each distinct version of a bundle, it will be archived as a `.zip` file (named in the form of `bundle_name_version.zip`) and stored in `Releases`.
